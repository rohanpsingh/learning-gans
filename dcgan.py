# Loss Functions and Optimizers
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# With :math:`D` and :math:`G` setup, we can specify how they learn
# through the loss functions and optimizers. We will use the Binary Cross
# Entropy loss
# (`BCELoss <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BCELoss.html#torch.nn.BCELoss>`__)
# function which is defined in PyTorch as:
# 
# .. math:: \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad l_n = - \left[ y_n \cdot \log x_n + (1 - y_n) \cdot \log (1 - x_n) \right]
# 
# Notice how this function provides the calculation of both log components
# in the objective function (i.e. :math:`log(D(x))` and
# :math:`log(1-D(G(z)))`). We can specify what part of the BCE equation to
# use with the :math:`y` input. This is accomplished in the training loop
# which is coming up soon, but it is important to understand how we can
# choose which component we wish to calculate just by changing :math:`y`
# (i.e. GT labels).
# 
# Next, we define our real label as 1 and the fake label as 0. These
# labels will be used when calculating the losses of :math:`D` and
# :math:`G`, and this is also the convention used in the original GAN
# paper. Finally, we set up two separate optimizers, one for :math:`D` and
# one for :math:`G`. As specified in the DCGAN paper, both are Adam
# optimizers with learning rate 0.0002 and Beta1 = 0.5. For keeping track
# of the generator’s learning progression, we will generate a fixed batch
# of latent vectors that are drawn from a Gaussian distribution
# (i.e. fixed_noise) . In the training loop, we will periodically input
# this fixed_noise into :math:`G`, and over the iterations we will see
# images form out of the noise.
# 

# Initialize the ``BCELoss`` function
criterion = nn.BCELoss()

# Create batch of latent vectors that we will use to visualize
#  the progression of the generator
fixed_noise = torch.randn(64, nz, 1, 1, device=device)

# Establish convention for real and fake labels during training
real_label = 1.
fake_label = 0.

# Setup Adam optimizers for both G and D
optimizerD = optim.Adam(netD.parameters(), lr=lr, betas=(beta1, 0.999))
optimizerG = optim.Adam(netG.parameters(), lr=lr, betas=(beta1, 0.999))

# Training
# ~~~~~~~~
# 
# Finally, now that we have all of the parts of the GAN framework defined,
# we can train it. Be mindful that training GANs is somewhat of an art
# form, as incorrect hyperparameter settings lead to mode collapse with
# little explanation of what went wrong. Here, we will closely follow
# Algorithm 1 from the `Goodfellow’s paper <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf>`__, 
# while abiding by some of the best
# practices shown in `ganhacks <https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks>`__.
# Namely, we will “construct different mini-batches for real and fake”
# images, and also adjust G’s objective function to maximize
# :math:`log(D(G(z)))`. Training is split up into two main parts. Part 1
# updates the Discriminator and Part 2 updates the Generator.
# 
# **Part 1 - Train the Discriminator**
# 
# Recall, the goal of training the discriminator is to maximize the
# probability of correctly classifying a given input as real or fake. In
# terms of Goodfellow, we wish to “update the discriminator by ascending
# its stochastic gradient”. Practically, we want to maximize
# :math:`log(D(x)) + log(1-D(G(z)))`. Due to the separate mini-batch
# suggestion from `ganhacks <https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks>`__,
# we will calculate this in two steps. First, we
# will construct a batch of real samples from the training set, forward
# pass through :math:`D`, calculate the loss (:math:`log(D(x))`), then
# calculate the gradients in a backward pass. Secondly, we will construct
# a batch of fake samples with the current generator, forward pass this
# batch through :math:`D`, calculate the loss (:math:`log(1-D(G(z)))`),
# and *accumulate* the gradients with a backward pass. Now, with the
# gradients accumulated from both the all-real and all-fake batches, we
# call a step of the Discriminator’s optimizer.
# 
# **Part 2 - Train the Generator**
# 
# As stated in the original paper, we want to train the Generator by
# minimizing :math:`log(1-D(G(z)))` in an effort to generate better fakes.
# As mentioned, this was shown by Goodfellow to not provide sufficient
# gradients, especially early in the learning process. As a fix, we
# instead wish to maximize :math:`log(D(G(z)))`. In the code we accomplish
# this by: classifying the Generator output from Part 1 with the
# Discriminator, computing G’s loss *using real labels as GT*, computing
# G’s gradients in a backward pass, and finally updating G’s parameters
# with an optimizer step. It may seem counter-intuitive to use the real
# labels as GT labels for the loss function, but this allows us to use the
# :math:`log(x)` part of the ``BCELoss`` (rather than the :math:`log(1-x)`
# part) which is exactly what we want.
# 
# Finally, we will do some statistic reporting and at the end of each
# epoch we will push our fixed_noise batch through the generator to
# visually track the progress of G’s training. The training statistics
# reported are:
# 
# -  **Loss_D** - discriminator loss calculated as the sum of losses for
#    the all real and all fake batches (:math:`log(D(x)) + log(1 - D(G(z)))`).
# -  **Loss_G** - generator loss calculated as :math:`log(D(G(z)))`
# -  **D(x)** - the average output (across the batch) of the discriminator
#    for the all real batch. This should start close to 1 then
#    theoretically converge to 0.5 when G gets better. Think about why
#    this is.
# -  **D(G(z))** - average discriminator outputs for the all fake batch.
#    The first number is before D is updated and the second number is
#    after D is updated. These numbers should start near 0 and converge to
#    0.5 as G gets better. Think about why this is.
# 
# **Note:** This step might take a while, depending on how many epochs you
# run and if you removed some data from the dataset.
